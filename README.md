Welcome to the SeatGeek Creative Developer Challenge!
​
SeatGeek FC need a new Season Ticket deposit page styled using similar branding to their existing ticketing site. 
​
Two example screenshots from this site can be seen here: https://projects.invisionapp.com/boards/DY40HBK7PHJ/
​
Your challenge is to style to match the existing pages above and to complete the additional tasks listed below to the index.html page within this package. You can only add code within the custom folder and cannot make any other changes to the existing files. The aim of the challenge is to test your CSS, JS and Creative abilities.
​
ADDITIONAL TASKS:
​
1. Change "2020 Seatgeek FC Deposits" to "2020 SeatGeek Season Ticket Deposit";
2. Change "Update Information" to a friendly message letting the user know they can only choose 2 tickets;
3. Only allow a maximum of 2 tickets to be chosen;
4. Disable the Checkout button until at least 1 ticket is chosen;
5. Reorder contact information to: Name, E-mail, Password;
6. Validate email;
7. Ensure there's no gap under the footer (The footer must stick to the bottom of the page if the content doesn't fill the screen);
8. The page must be responsive;
9. Create a mobile version of the page with a burger nav (tip: this is your chance to be creative, consider the process of going from your ideas to the final solution).
